# Malware

Malware is an insanely cool invention. That doesn't sound too good but the way they work is pretty cool. Here is a list of common malware and how they work:

Viruses:

- Viruses attach themselves to executable files or programs. When the infected program is executed, the virus activates and can replicate by attaching itself to other programs. It may also have a payload that causes harm to the system.



  
Worms:

- Worms are standalone programs that replicate independently. They spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in networked systems, often using automated methods. Worms can travel across networks and infect multiple devices.



  
Trojan Horses:

- Trojans disguise themselves as legitimate software or files. Once the user installs or executes them, they may create a backdoor for other malware, steal sensitive information, or perform other malicious activities.



  
Ransomware:

- Ransomware encrypts files on a user's device, rendering them inaccessible. The victim is then demanded to pay a ransom (usually in cryptocurrency) to receive the decryption key. It can spread through email attachments, malicious links, or exploit vulnerabilities.




Spyware:

- Spyware silently monitors and collects user data without their knowledge. This may include keystrokes, browsing habits, and personal information. The collected data is sent to a remote server for malicious purposes, such as identity theft.






Adware:

- Adware displays unwanted advertisements, often in the form of pop-ups or banners. While not necessarily harmful, it can be disruptive and may lead to poor system performance. Adware is often bundled with free software.




 
Botnets:

- Botnets are networks of compromised computers, known as bots, controlled by a central server. They can be used for various malicious activities, including DDoS attacks, spreading spam, or stealing sensitive information.




Rootkits:

- Rootkits are designed to hide the presence of malware on a system. They often modify the operating system or kernel components, making it difficult for antivirus software to detect them. Rootkits are commonly used to maintain unauthorized access.




Keyloggers:

- Keyloggers record keystrokes on a computer, capturing sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. This information is then sent to the attacker, who can use it for unauthorized access or identity theft.




Backdoors:

- Backdoors provide unauthorized access to a system. They are often installed by other malware, creating a hidden entry point for attackers to control the system remotely.




Fileless Malware:

- Fileless malware operates in a system's memory, avoiding detection by traditional antivirus solutions that focus on file-based threats. It typically exploits vulnerabilities in legitimate system tools and processes.



This is a pretty short post but malware is very complicated and I am grasping creating it, for professional reasons of course. Thanks for reading my blog post and come back tomorrow for more cyber topics.

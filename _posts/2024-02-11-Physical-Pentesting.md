# Physical Pentesting

Physical Pentesting is by far my favorite topic in cybersecurity. I'm not sure if I love it because of the psychology involved or the feeling of being some sort of spy. It all started for me in high school when some people from a healthcare company called Ohio Health came in and gave us a speech on cybersecurity and pen testing. Today we are going to go over some physical pen testing methods that could, hypothetically, work in the field.

## 1. Mapping Entrances and Knowing the Layout
Pretty much the first thing we would want to do is scout out the location where we are doing the pentest. We can use tools like Google Maps, a physical map, and hypothetically, we could try to find a building layout online. Accomplishing this is one of the easiest parts of the physical pentest. So let's set out an actual scenario and go through how we might work through it.
- **The Scenario:**




You are conducting a pentest on the McDonald's in South Bloomfield, Ohio. You are tasked with getting into the manager's office in the back of the kitchen. Scout this location:

While this is fairly easy when you use something like Google Maps you will see that you can get close to the entire building, this is what we want, although we will not always be able to do this, especially if the company is some sort of factory.

# Network Security

Network security, though not talked about enough, is one of the main things companies have to worry about. A lot of the 
time when we talk about cybersecurity, it's highly glorified to encompass hackers, and it never really goes behind the scenes.
While hackers are pretty much the reason for cybersecurity, we need to look deeper and understand the frameworks and how to 
protect them. Although basic network security is good, I feel we need to look at some advanced-level architecture to get the 
full grasp of what companies are actually doing.

## Advanced Level Network Security
This involves a multi-layered approach that uses not only techniques but also takes human behavior into view. Some of the advanced 
concepts and stregies are listed below:
- Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): 
This model assumes that threats could be both external and internal, and therefore, trust should 
not be automatically granted to any user or device, whether inside or outside the network perimeter. Zero Trust requires strict 
identity verification, continuous monitoring, and least privilege access controls.

- Microsegmentation: 
Rather than segmenting the network into large, coarse-grained segments, microsegmentation divides it into 
smaller, more granular segments. This allows for precise enforcement of security policies based on individual workloads, 
applications, or data flows, reducing the attack surface and limiting lateral movement by attackers.


- Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Security: 
SDN separates the network control plane from the data plane, providing centralized
management and programmability. Advanced SDN security measures include dynamic policy enforcement, automated threat response,
and integration with threat intelligence feeds for adaptive security posture.

- Behavioral Analytics and Machine Learning: 
Advanced security solutions leverage behavioral analytics and machine learning algorithms
to detect anomalies and identify potential security threats based on patterns of user behavior, network traffic, or system activity.
These technologies enhance threat detection capabilities beyond traditional signature-based methods.

- Deception Technologies: 
Deception technologies deploy decoy assets, such as fake network services, endpoints, or data, to lure 
attackers and gather intelligence about their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Deception can help detect and mitigate 
advanced threats, including targeted attacks and insider threats.

- Blockchain for Network Security:
Blockchain technology offers decentralized, tamper-resistant data storage and transaction 
verification, which can enhance the security and integrity of network communications, authentication processes, and distributed 
applications. Use cases include secure identity management, transparent auditing, and decentralized threat intelligence sharing.




In the end, all of these security measures could fail for a multitude of reasons. With this in mind, they still need to be 
in place 100%. The combination of all the tactics and other tactics we have talked about in this blog are a great start to
keeping your company safe. Thanks for reading my blog. If you enjoyed it, reach out to me on some of my socials! Thanks, and

#Secure Access Service Edge
A Secure Access Service Edge, also known as a SASE is a cloud framework that combines networking and security functions into a single platform.
It creates seamless access and enhances security by integrating capabilities like Software-Defined Wide Area networking (SD-WAN), Secure Web Gateway (SGW),
Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB), Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS), and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), providing everytrhing a company could 
need for pretecting users, devices, and data, no matter where it's stored.

SASE has become a nessaity since more and more jobs allow remote work. By providing granular access controls and identity based auth, sensative data
should only be access by authorized personael. It is likley that you're data will be safe using this method of protection, but as always someone
somewhere could get in.

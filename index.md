    <p>Hi there, this is my blog and here I will showcase things revolving around Cyber Security, things I've seen in the field and anything else I see fit.</p>
    
    <p>My name is Logan Crabtree and I have been in the cyber field for almost a year now. I was an intern pentester for AEP, with a focus on red teaming (obviously) in Web Development. It was quite fun but unfortunately, it had to come to an end. I want to work in all fields of cyber security eventually but my dream job is to be a physical pentester. I have started learning how to lockpick and from time to time I practice social engineering.</p>
    
    <p>My journey has been a bumpy one but I'm keeping my head down and grinding out what I need to. I started college in 2020 right out of high school but I took some detours along the way. I am currently almost done with school; graduating this year. So that's a little bit about me.</p>

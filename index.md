<h2>About Me</h2>
Hi there, this is my blog and here I will showcase things revolving 
around Cyber Security, things I've seen in the field and anything else I see fit.

My name is Logan Crabtree and I have been in the cyber field for almost a year now. 
I was a intern pentester for AEP, with a focus on red teaming (obviously) in Web Development. 
It was quite fun but unfortunately it had to come to an end. I want to work in all fields of 
cyber security eventually but, my dream job is to be a physical pentester. I have started learning 
how to lockpick and from time to time I practice social engineering.

My journey has been a bumpy one but I'm keeping my head down and grinding out what I need to. I 
started college in 2020 right out of highschool but I took some detours along the way. I am currently
almost done with school; graduating this year. So thats a little bit about me.

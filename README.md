My name is Logan Crabtree and I have been in the cyber field for almost a year now. 
I was a intern pentester for AEP, with a focus on red teaming (obviously) in Web Development. 
I want to work in all fields of cyber security eventually but, my dream job is to be a physical 
pentester. I have started learning how to lockpick and from time to time I practice social engineering on
people I know. Outside of cyber I am a beekeeper, I play video games, I love playing pool, and I hang out with my loving wife.

I'm keeping my head down and grinding out what I need to. I started college in 2020 right out 
of highschool but I took some detours along the way. I am currently
almost done with school; graduating this year (2024). So thats a little bit about me.
